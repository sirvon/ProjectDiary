Today I worked on the thinking behind modeling the data objects.
Thinking of loqootv as a domain with diff objs, relating with each
other to accomplish the final output of a Scene being displayed on
A TV, or in a Remote's Feed.


The visual of the feed was also produced today as a preliminary sketch.
The feed being a strea of incoming scenes, that lead upon touch to
it's respected channel. 

Data & domain modeling bring the concepts hidden in brain cells to a
birth in the real world.

The MySql tables that will store exisiting data such as open data catalogs
and other public information was also shaped today.
