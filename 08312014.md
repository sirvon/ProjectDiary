GIT-PYTHON
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GitPython/0.3.2.RC1
2 words, 2 worlds!

The project is now closer to having two environments to play and work in.
A prod/beta env and a devmode env structures have been plotted out, with the major
assistance of git-python library. This library offers us the ability to ability in our code to
determine with branch we are currently on and have the program act accordingly.

So, If we are on the xperimental branch, then code using the xperimental incoming SMS
#will be executed or new xperimental functions we are working on, will be called accordingly.

But when the code is shipped to Beta or Production environments, since they travel via git anyways, even with some dev instructions inside the code, the production code will always
just run.

Git Python is an amazing tool, on top of an already amazing tool.
Thank You @git-pythondevelopers

Abstract Base Classes
The understanding is there….about these pseudo guiding classes/self documenting classes.
The incoming data (datastream) coming into the system needs to transform and magically appear as other objects at times in the system.

Sometimes they need to be considered a group other, other times just as a datastream.

But with the guiding principle that everything in the system is a group, that have group attributes and tendencies and perform group based behaviors, then A Group is A Base Classes, that all objects in the system should be clothed with.

The code is coming……
