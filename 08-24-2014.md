Finally got the incoming scene flow being stored in Mongodb and in Usergrid.
as Every datastream object comes in it is stored in mongo and every individual object of concern
is stored as a collection entity in usergrid.

datastream.scene --> usergrid

research on google's BigQuery tool has begun is plotting the steps necessary to getting that streaming
data into a analytic pipeline that was generate visuals, similarites, and predictions
to keep back into the system. It pretty much entails pushing each json into a script, that data is then
put into a table.

Mortar is also being investigated, because of it's ease
of use to get data out of mongodb.
